# ProGrad Lab | BLOG - SAVE BLOG IN EXCEL

## A Quick Introduction

Inspired by Wattpad, Mr. Alex is on a mission to build "CODE WALL" - A community for developers. He has laid out a plan & hired a designer & developer to work on the project. Unfortunately, due to some trust issues, he had to fire them. He is suspicious that one of his competitors is trying to steal his idea & work on it quickly even before him.
